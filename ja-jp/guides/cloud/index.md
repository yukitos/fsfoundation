Cloud computing relies on leveraging multiple integrated services.  Using multiple services required a unique set 
of technologies and capabilities, and F# excels in this domain.  With the recent rise of cloud solutions, it has becoming increasingly easy to deploy multiple services "in the cloud", expanding what is possible both by storing large amounts of data and running heavy computations distributed across clusters of machines.  

The combination of built in support for asynchronous workflows, data processing capabilities, computation expressions, 
extensible syntax, composability, expressiveness for numeric code and more make F# uniquely suited to develop 
scalable cloud solutions efficiently. 

This guide is an overview of the packages and tools for scalable compute, messaging, storage, and data processing with F#, 
particularly for taking advantage of cloud-computing resources. 

For cloud-hosted web programming and services, refer to the [Web Programming Guide](/guides/web/).

### Cloud Platforms

#### [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide a large array of on-demand and managed computing and 
hosting services. AWS include on-demand and reserved virtual machine instances, 
a variety of storage options, a content delivery network (CDN), DNS capabilities, and many others. 
Amazon offers services from multiple data centers around the world.

Amazon offers a .NET SDK for managing the AWS services, 
[described here](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/). This SDK provides facilities for managing 
storage, compute instances, and other Amazon services.
