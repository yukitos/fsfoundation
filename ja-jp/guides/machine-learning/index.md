F# is well-suited to machine learning because of its efficient execution, succinct style,
data access capabilities and scalability. F# has been successfully used by some of the most advanced 
machine learning teams in the world, including several groups at Microsoft Research.

[Try F#](http://tryfsharp.org/learn) has some introductory machine learning algorithms.
Further resources related to different aspects of machine learning are below.

Related material also exists in other Guides.  For detailed information, refer to the guides for:

### Machine Learning Packages

Several F# machine learning packages are available. Some are accessed through F#'s interoperability mechanisms to R, Python and Java. .NET packages can be found by [searching on nuget.org](http://nuget.org/packages?q=machine+learning). For example:

 * [Accord.MachineLearning](http://nuget.org/packages/Accord.MachineLearning/) - Contains Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayesian models, K-means, Gaussian Mixture models and general algorithms such as Ransac, Cross-validation and Grid-Search for machine-learning applications. This package is part of the Accord.NET Framework.
   See also [First steps with Accord.NET SVM in F#](http://www.clear-lines.com/blog/category/Machine-Learning.aspx)

 * [R Packages](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/) - All R packages can be accessed through the [RProvider for F#](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/).
   See, for example, [F# Neural Networks with the RProvider and Deedle](http://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/f-neural-networks-with-rprovider-deedle/)

 * [Vulpes](https://github.com/SpiegelSoft/Vulpes) - A machine learning app using a deep belief network and connecting to the NVIDIA GPU unit using [Alea.cuBase](http://blog.quantalea.net/).

 * [Ariadne](http://evelinag.com/Ariadne/) - Library for fitting Gaussian process regression models.

 * [Encog Machine Learning Framework](http://nuget.org/packages/encog-dotnet-core/) - An advanced neural network and machine learning framework. Encog
   contains classes to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process data for these neural networks. Encog trains using multithreaded resilient propagation. Encog can also make use of a GPU to further speed processing time. A GUI based workbench is also provided to help model and train neural networks.
   See, for example, [ENCOG Neural Network XOR example in F#](http://relentlessdevelopment.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/hello-neurons-encog-neural-network-xor-example-in-f/)

 * [Numl](http://nuget.org/packages/numl/) - A machine learning library intended to ease the use of using standard modeling techniques for both prediction and clustering

 * [DiffSharp](http://diffsharp.github.io/DiffSharp/) - An automatic differentiation (AD) library for incorporating derivative calculations with minimal changes into existing code, providing exact and efficient gradients, Jacobians and Hessians for machine learning and optimization applications.
