Data science is the application of statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization and programming to 
real-world data sources to bring understanding and insight to data-oriented problem domains.
F# is an excellent solution for programmatic data science as it combines efficient execution,
REPL-scripting, powerful libraries and scalable data integration. 

As data science employs techniques from many problem domains, numerous base technologies are required. F# has very
strong support for integration with many systems and libraries, both via direct usage of .NET libraries and type providers, which provide interoperability support with Excel, R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica, and more. For details on 
interoperability with these systems, see:

* [F# with Excel](#excel-interop)
* [F# with R](#r-interop)
* [F# with MATLAB](#matlab-interop)
* [F# with Mathematica](#mathematica-interop)
* [F# with Python](#python-interop)

Many other resources are available for integrating F#, C# and .NET with these systems. If a resource specific
to F# can't be found, then search for C# instead and adjust the technique appropriately.
Data science also requires strong support for many technologies covered in other Guides.  For detailed information, refer to the guides for:

* [Math and Statistics](/guides/math-and-statistics/)
* [Data Access](/guides/data-access/)
* [Machine Learning](/guides/machine-learning/)
* [Cloud Programming](/guides/cloud/)


[Try F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org/Learn/data-science) contains information and tutorials for learning data science in F#.

### Integrated Packages

[FsLab](http://fslab.org/) is an integrated, cross-platform collection of open source data science pacakges for F#, including FSharp.Data, Deedle, RProvider, Math.NET Numerics and more.

  * [Understanding the world with F# (video)](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Understanding-the-World-with-F)


### Data Visualization

#### Interactive Charting on Windows 

* [FSharp.Charting](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Charting/) - an interactive charting library frequently used on Windows.

* [XPlot](http://tahahachana.github.io/XPlot/) - XPlot is a data visualization package for the F# programming language powered by popular JavaScript charting libraries. It uses Google and Plotly's powerful and free data visualization libraries based on HTML5/SVG technology.  You can access the HTML for the charts programatically and use the library from F# Interactive by displaying browser windows.

#### Using R, MATLAB, Mathematica, Excel and Python for Data Visualization

F# can integrate with systems such as R, MATLAB, Mathematica, Excel and Python and these can be used for data visualization.
See below for more details and the following tutorials specific to visualization:

* [Using F#, R and GGPlot2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16820211/r-type-provider-and-ggplot2)
* [Tutorial: Charting with Excel from F#](http://bit.ly/10WksjA)
* [Tutorial: Charting with Gnuplot from F#](http://bit.ly/14RwJeW)


### Exploratory Data and Time Series Programming

[Deedle](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/) is an easy-to-use, high quality 
package for data and time series manipulation and for scientific programming. 
It uses a design similar to the Pandas library from Python and the 'tseries' or 'zoo' packages in R, though
with stronger typing. Deedle supports working with structured data frames, ordered and unordered data, as well as time series. Deedle is designed to 
work well for exploratory programming using F# and C# interactive console, but can be also used in 
efficient compiled .NET code.

### F# and Excel 

#### Integrating F# and Excel through FCell

[FCell](http://fcell.io) lets you dynamically create Excel Ribbon, Custom Task Panes, and UDFs in F#, C# and VB. 
FCell enables you to type F# directly into the spreadsheet and see changes reflected at a push of a button. 
Code and DLLs are embedded into the workbook and can be emailed to end users as a single spreadsheet. 
FCell allows the use of many advanced F# features directly from within Excel such as Async and Observables 
for non-blocking UDFs, WSDL Type Provider for a SOA backed Front Office, R Type Provider for Machine Learning, 
and the Hive Type Provider for Big Data manipulation.

 * [FCell home pages](http://fcell.io/)

#### Integrating F# and Excel through Excel-DNA

[Excel-DNA](http://excel-dna.net/) is an independent project to integrate .NET into Excel. With Excel-DNA you can make native (.xll) add-ins for Excel using C#, Visual Basic.NET or F#, providing high-performance user-defined functions (UDFs), custom ribbon interfaces 
and more. Your entire add-in can be packed into a single .xll file requiring no installation or registration:

 * [Combining F# and Excel using Excel DNA](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/archive/2013/07/16/combining-f-and-excel-using-excel-dna-some-links.aspx)
 * [Async and event-streaming Excel UDFs with F#](http://excel-dna.net/2013/03/26/async-and-event-streaming-excel-udfs-with-f/)
 * [Machine Learning with Excel: Combine the power of Excel, F# and R](http://luajalla.azurewebsites.net/excel-dna-three-stories/)

#### Integrating F# and Excel through Open Office XML file manipulation

[NPOI](https://npoi.codeplex.com/) is .NET version of POI Java project at http://poi.apache.org/. POI is an open source project which can help you read/write xls, doc, ppt files.

 * [Example of how to work with Excel using NPOI in F#](https://github.com/Heather/FXL/blob/master/RNExceL/Model/NPOI.fs#L19)

[EPPlus](http://epplus.codeplex.com) is a .NET library that reads and writes Excel 2007/2010/2013 files using the Open Office XML format (xlsx)
 
[ExcelPackageF](https://github.com/igorkulman/ExcelPackageF) is a simple F# wrapper over the EPPlus library.
 
Both NPOI and EPPLus manipulate the Open Office XML format directly so they do not require having Excel installed and do not use Interop. You can read, create, and edit Excel documents using this approach.

#### Interoperating with Excel through type providers

[F# Excel Type Provider](http://fsprojects.github.io/ExcelProvider/) is an prototypical F# type providerfor Excel that allows you  to read Excel files using typed data provided by the type provider. 

#### Interoperating with Excel through API's

F# can interoperate with Excel through existing Excel API's. For example:

 * [Plot functions from F# to Excel](http://www.clear-lines.com/blog/post/Plot-functions-from-FSharp-to-Excel.aspx)
 * [Charting with Excel from F#](http://bit.ly/GGv8z4)

There are also some F# versions of Excel functions, useful when migrating code:
