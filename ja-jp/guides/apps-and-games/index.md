F# executes on a broad range of app and gaming platforms such as  [Android](/use/android/), [iOS](/use/ios/), 
[Mac OS X](/use/mac/), [JavaScript/HTML5](/webstacks) and [Windows](/use/windows/). Its concise syntax, interoperability
with .NET libraries, and its ability to manage complexity of components such as state machines, calculation engines, and more
make it an ideal tool for many aspects of game and app development.

In addition, F# has excellent support for managing the server-side of games or apps. This provides a compelling story of full stack development with a single language for both client and server. See the [Web Programming](/webstacks) and [Cloud](/cloud) section for details of using F# with server-side technologies. For example, F# is used on the server-side of one of 
the largest Facebook social games, as described in [this interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=846).

### MonoGame

[MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) is an open implementation of a cross-platform gaming framework originally
based on the XNA 4 framework design. The goal of the project is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows and 
Windows Phone to port their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Metro, and PlayStation 
Mobile.
