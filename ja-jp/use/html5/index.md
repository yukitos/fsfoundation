### Option 1: Use WebSharper

![WebSharper](/images/thumbs/WebSharper.png)&nbsp;[WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com) supports F# and can be used to make F# client-side or cross-tier HTML5 web apps. These can be used from any HTML5-enabled browser.


<br />

### Option 2: Use FunScript

[FunScript](http://funscript.info/) is a standalone converter from F# to JavaScript. 
It also offers strongly typed interoperability with any components given a TypeScript signature.

<br />

### Option 3: Use F# on the Server with JavaScript, CoffeeScript or TypeScript on the client

You can use F# on the server with JavaScript, CoffeeScript or TypeScript as the front end, in conjunction 
with modern JS/HTML5 web frameworks. More details at [F# Web Programming](/guides/web/).
