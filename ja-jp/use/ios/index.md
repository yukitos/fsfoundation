### Option 1: Build F# iOS Apps using Xamarin Studio

![logo](/images/thumbs/xamarin-studio.png)&nbsp;[Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) provide F# tools for Android and iOS mobile development with F#, using Xamarin Studio out of the box.

#### Installing

1. Get [Xamarin Studio and the F# Tools for Mac](/use/mac)

2. Create a new Project, select "F#" and then the kind of application you want.

You can now create a new F# iOS app, e.g. an "iPad Single View Application".  See the 
[Mobile Apps and Games](/apps-and-games) section for more information on getting going with F# iOS development.
