> The F# code is consistently shorter, easier to read, easier to refactor and contains far fewer bugs.
> As our data analysis tools have developed ... we've become more productive. 

1. **Kaggle**
2. [permalink](#kaggle-1)

At Kaggle we initially chose F# for our core data analysis algorithms because of its expressiveness. 
We've been so happy with the choice that we've found ourselves moving more and more of 
our application out of C# and into F#. The F# code is consistently shorter, easier to read, 
easier to refactor, and, because of the strong typing, contains far fewer bugs.

As our data analysis tools have developed, we've seen domain-specific constructs 
emerge very naturally; as our codebase gets larger, we become more productive. 

The fact that F# targets the CLR was also critical - even though we have a large existing 
code base in C#, getting started with F# was an easy decision because 
we knew we could use new modules right away.

I have written an application to balance the national power generation schedule for a portfolio 
of power stations to a trading position for an energy company. The client and server components 
were in C# but the calculation engine was written in F#. 

The use of F# to address the complexity at the heart of this application clearly demonstrates 
a sweet spot for the language within enterprise software, namely algorithmically complex 
analysis of large data sets. My experience has been a very positive one.

Building valuation models for derivative trades requires rapid development of mathematical models, made possible by 
composition of lower-level model components. We have found that F#, with the associated toolset, provides a 
unique combination of features that make it very well suited to this kind of development. In this talk, I will explain how we 
are using F# and show why it is a good match. I will also talk about the problems we have had, 
and outline future enhancements that would benefit this kind of work.

> The performance is phenomenal.  We can now re-calculate the entire bank portfolio from scratch in 
> less than a second and the response-time for single deal verification calculation is far below 100 milliseconds.

1. **Jan Erik Ekelof**, M.Sc.
2. Head IT-architect and lead developer Counterparty Risk
3. Handelsbanken 
4. [permalink](#handelsbanken-1)
 
I first evaluated F# back in 2006 - 2007 for the purpose of math oriented high performance applications within 
Financial Risk. I got in spring 2009 a mission to implement a new Real-time Counter-party Risk system covering 
all possible present and future deal types within the entire bank. The effort was started with only three 
resources, me as architect and lead developer and two colleagues – one risk expert and one high performing 
developer. Our first intention was to use C#, but I did a quick proof-of-concept with F# implementing a low 
level TCP/IP-communication to an existing risk-system. This showed us and our  management that F# could give 
us a real productivity boost due to its support for multiple paradigms and functional concepts together with 
an impressive support for multi-threading. 

Our first delivery is approaching rapidly and F# has proved itself as a real life-saver. We started off using 
C# in many places but have since then moved almost entirely into F# due to its ability to reduce the amount of 
code required and its simplicity when developing massive parallel computations. The performance is phenomenal. 
We can now re-calculate the entire bank portfolio from scratch in less than a second and the response-time for 
single deal verification calculation is far below 100 milliseconds(the original demand was 200 milliseconds to 
make the application usable for electronic markets). Although some gains are to be attributed to how we have built 
our calculation models, F# made it possible for us to implement our algorithms and techniques with very little code 
and with a huge similarity to the original mathematical models and regulations (which is important for verification 
of correctness). We have also been able to use the support for Async-workflows producing code that is simple and 
clear and easy to understand but still runs in parallel when required. 
 
The present application contains 35 to 40.000 lines of F#-code and an equal amount of C#-code. However, our 
estimate is that the F# code contains at least 80% of the functionality (which is pretty amazing!). Our experience 
shows us that the number of code lines shrinks with a ratio of 1/2 to 1/4 by just porting functionality from 
C# to F# (not counting single character or empty lines in the C#-code). We have by remodeling increased the 
ratio to the area of 1/5 to 1/8, where the remodeling involves replacing object oriented constructs with 
functional ones (and actually removing mutable states). One example from last week was a limit-utilization 
module written in F# but using an object-oriented approach containing +300 lines of code. I rewrote it to 
below 70 lines of code just by shifting paradigm (and the rewrite made it much easier to understand and verify)!

> The benefits of functional programming in F# have given us a great advantage over our slow moving competitors.  

1. Bayard Rock
2. [permalink](#bayard-rock-1)

At Bayard Rock we work hard every day in the pursuit of new approaches towards anti-money-laundering.  Before adopting F# there were often months of turnaround time between development of an idea and actually testing it on real data in our production environment.  F#’s succinctness and composability allows us to rapidly iterate on ideas while the type system acts as a safety net. On top of this, it has the advantage of being a first class member of the .NET ecosystem and so integrates seamlessly with our Microsoft stack systems. This means that instead of months we can often see our ideas come to life in just days.
 
The benefits of functional programming in F# have given us a great advantage over our slow moving competitors.  After three years of using F# our products have consistently gotten significantly better each year without sacrificing stability.  Our clients often are amazed by how we can quickly adapt to unique challenges and how we can find the bad guys hiding in their data much more effectively than anyone else.  Little do they know that it’s largely thanks to our secret weapon, F#.

For nearly 75 years, Grange Insurance has offered competitive products and services to policyholders 
in more than a dozen U.S. states. To maintain its well-earned reputation and standing, the company decided to 
enhance its rating engine—a software tool for rating policies and performing what-if modeling, impact analyses, 
and other vital activities. Working with the Sophic Group and using the Microsoft Visual Studio Team System development 
environment and F# programming language, Grange Insurance parallelized its rating engine to take
better advantage of multicore server hardware, and in so doing garnered significant performance benefits. 
Processes that used to require hours now take just minutes, enabling the company to trim time-to-market 
by weeks and making it far easier for independent agents to sell and service Grange products.

> Large insurance company developed an entire pension quote calculator entirely in F# in under 100 days with no prior F# experience at all...

1. **Large insurance company**
2. [source 1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/952318/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-c-sharp-vs-f-or-f-vs-c), [source 2](http://www.quora.com/Which-organizations-use-the-F-programming-language-in-a-non-trivial-fashion/answer/Jon-Harrop-1), [permalink](#aviva-flying-frog-1)

One of the world's largest insurance companies have F# code in production, are starting several 
more projects in F#. We are currently consulting for this company (£2.5bn profit) who have migrated 
some of their number crunching and business logic to F# and are so happy with the results 
(10x faster and 10x less code vs their Visual C++ 6) that they are proposing to migrate 1,600,000 lines of code to 
F#. In particular, their developers found F# easy to learn and use.

... my predecessor developed an entire pension quote calculator (typically scheduled to take 300-400 man days) 
entirely in F# in under 100 days with no prior F# experience at all. Performance is 10× 
better than the C++ that it replaces because the new code avoids unnecessary copying and exploits multicore 
parallelism. Part of my job here will be to give basic F# training to around 20 people and bring a few people up to expert level.

In answer to "Can you give any evidence for 10x performance gain over C++?". The insurer's C++ 
code is a simple manual translation from very inefficient Mathematica code that suffers from several pathological 
performance problems mainly centered around excessive copying. The F# rewrite does not have these problem. 
The 10x performance gain was verified by the client.

F# is becoming an increasingly important part of our server side infrastructure that supports
our mobile and web-based social games with millions of active users. F# first came to prominence
in our technology stack in the implementation of the rules engine for our social slots games 
which by now serve over **700,000 unique players** and **150,000,000 requests** per day at peaks 
of several thousand requests per second.
The F# solution offers us an **order of magnitude increase in productivity** and allows
one developer to perform the work that are performed by a team of dedicated developers on an 
existing Java-based solution, and is critical in supporting our agile approach and bi-weekly 
release cycles.

The [agent-based programming model](http://www.developerfusion.com/article/139804/an-introduction-to-f-agents/) 
offered by F#'s MailboxProcessor allows us to **build thread-safe components with high-concurrency requirements effortlessly**, without using locks and sacrificing maintainability and complexity.
These agent-based solutions also offer much improved efficiency and latency whilst running at scale.
Indeed our agent-based stateful server for our [MMORPG](https://apps.facebook.com/herebemonsters/)
has proved a big success and great cost saver that we're in the process of rolling it out across
all of our social games!

We wanted to develop our Android and iOS applications using as much shared code as possible.
We built a reactive architecture using F# actors (aka mailbox processors) to build a very robust
multithreaded system that was easily portable between Android and iOS.

Our F# actors (shared across iOS and Android) expose .Net IObservables that are consumed by UI systems written for the native platforms.
Dividing the system in that way allowed for testable multithreaded code that would have been difficult to write in other .Net languages.

> For a machine learning scientist, speed of experimentation is the critical factor to optimize.  

1. **Patrice Simard**
2. Distinguished Engineer
3. Microsoft 
4. [permalink](#simard-1)

I wrote the first prototype of the click prediction system deployed in Microsoft AdCenter in F# in a few days.  
 
For a machine learning scientist, speed of experimentation is the critical factor to optimize.  Compiling is 
fast but loading large amounts of data in memory takes a long time.  With F#’s REPL, you only need to load the 
data once and you can then code and explore in the interactive environment.  Unlike C# and C++, F# was designed 
for this mode of interaction.  It has the ease of use of Matlab or Python, both of which I have used extensively 
in the past. One problem with Matlab and Python is that they are not strongly typed.  No compile-time type 
checking hurts speed of experimentation because of bugs, lack of reusability, high cost of refactoring, no 
intellisense, and slow execution.  Switching to F# was liberating and exhilarating.  2 caveats: Not every 
problem fits that model.  With a bit of discipline, such as avoiding massive parallelism for as long as 
possible, the model goes a long way.  The second caveat is that the cost of learning F# is steep.  For me, it 
was 2 weeks of decreased productivity. It has proven a worthwhile investment.
 
As a machine learning practitioner programming in F#, I constantly switch between two activities: 
1) writing prototype code (highly interactive ugly code with throw away results, functions, and visualizations) 
and 2) upgrading prototype code to library standard (fast, generic, reusable).  When I go back to writing 
prototypes, I build on top of the newly upgraded functions.  In F#, the cost of switching between these two 
modes is minimal: often nothing needs to be done other than adding comments and deleting deprecated functions.  
This means that most of the time is dedicated to experimenting and the majority of the code is close to shipping 
quality.  Some people can do this in C# or Matlab, but I find that F# excels at it.
 
I started F# with deep suspicions regarding efficiency.  My first test was to link F# with C++/CLI and 
check performance of calling SSE/AVX optimized code.  As hoped, F# is comparable to C# when it comes to 
speed.  You have the same flexibility to link with well optimized code.  The inline generics are truly 
magical: same IL in the linked DLLs, but the functions expand to specialized fast code when you instantiate
them.  Compromises between intuitive code and efficient code still need to be made. I found that “for” loop, 
“tail recursive” loop, or Parallel.For with ThreadLocal loops, are faster than a succession of piped IEnumerables 
(seq in F#).  F# does not hamper one’s ability to write ugly fast code.  Rest assured.
 
Several people in the machine learning group in Microsoft Research have switched to F# for the reasons 
above.  The world is slowly moving toward functional programming with good justifications: the code is 
cleaner and easier to debug in a distributed environment.  Among the available functional languages, F# 
is a compelling option.

> We see great potential for F# to be used as a scripting language in CAD; it fits very well for computational design challenges in the construction industry.

<a href="http://www.waagner-biro.com/en/company/news-press/news/oriental-jewel-by-waagner-biro-the-domed-roof-of-the-louvre-abu-dhabi"> <img src="/img/big/goswin-waggner.png" /></a>

In recent years many Architects have discovered that they can greatly enlarge their design repertoire by the use of parametric design, programming or scripting. Architects can now quickly and easily explore new geometries previously unseen in Architecture. Besides being designed in a novel way these geometries can also be exactly represented and reasoned about in terms of structural feasibility and manufacturing constraints. These facts take new geometries out of the dreams of Architects and make them real candidates for construction.

One such project is the *Louvre Abu Dhabi* by Jean Nouvel. Waagner-Biro was awarded the construction contract for the Dome. For the cladding of this dome more than 450´000 individual cutting and drilling patterns of custom aluminium extrusions had to be described and automated. The sheer scale and complexity of the cladding on the dome required us to re-evaluate our parametric design approach. I developed an F# application to represent and organize all cladding elements of the dome. It includes a small geometry kernel and an adapted version of the Half Edge Data Structure to efficiently query the neighbourhood of each element. I used Rhino and its .NET API to host the F# DLL for drawing and visualisation. This application enabled us to have an integrated workflow from the main geometry setout all the way down to the manufacturing data in a single parametric model. This project was the first use of F# at Waagner-Biro for a large scale project. The switch to F# from dynamic scripting languages helped to reduce development time and execution time. The strongly typed environment, algebraic data types and immutable data helped to avoid a whole range of bugs and fits well the domain of generating static 3d geometry. I see great potential for F# to be used as scripting languages in CAD, especially since most big CAD packages already offer a .NET API.

As a business we actively seek improvement every single day. This is the same for our IT systems, 
so we have been searching for a means to do that in our in-house software systems.
 
The F# type system has allowed us to do this - by eliminating null references, increasing type 
safety and creating rich domain models that help us express hard-and-fast business rules in a 
way that we can really lean on the compiler; while actually reducing our total lines of code 
(and noise!). Doing so has reduced both our requirement for expensive bug hunts in our 
production systems, and the overall cost of maintaining unnecessary code complexity.
 
We have been evaluating F# for a year now, and have components in our production systems that 
have been bug-free since deployment. The results speak for themselves.

We are using F# because it considerably increases speed of software development which is crucial 
for a small company with limited development resources.  The most enjoyable feature of this language 
is that the developer can reason about the code instead of relying only on unit tests. 
I would say the language encourages Reason Driven Development methodology which leads to 
virtually bug-free code.  F# as strongly typed functional language ideally fits for tasks our

The credit markets have varying pockets of liquidity. Market participants would like to understand how the

needed to provide these metrics across the entire CDS universe. Functional programming and specifically 
F# was used  in order to provide the market with a fast and accurate solution. ... The research and development cycle was made faster and more efficient by the effective use of 
functional programming. 

The efficient use of functional programming throughout the R&amp;D cycle helped make the cycle faster and more efficient.
Less time was spent on translating requirements, miscommunications etc and more on producing a fast and accurate solution quickly.

Since programmers can understand your quant code they can focus on their core competency – developing fast and reliable production code.
The development exercise becomes catered towards optimization, performance tuning and error handling (i.e. making the code reliable)
Functionality is not lost from the prototype due to miscommunication or rather crude documentation/requirements, which saves time in testing.
Mass regression testing is easy with precise precision level differences between the prototype and the production system.

Also, the MSF supplied F# functional wrapper is a great way of using Solver Foundation from F#.

Every day we analyze data for hundreds of thousand of properties, sourced from XML and JSON feeds. Features such as Options and Type Providers have given us incredibly concise, expressive, and testable code with which to handle them, freeing us to focus on business value.

As a developer moving from C#, some of the concepts you read about functional programming can be difficult to grasp and the barrier to entry appears high. However, with just a basic understanding and a helpful and welcoming community, F# has proven to be very productive and has quickly become my language of choice.

Around 95% of the code in these projects has been developed in F#. F# allowed for rapid development 
of prototypes, and thus also rapid verification or falsification of the underlying mathematical models.
Complex algorithms, for example to compute Nash equilibria in game theory, can be expressed 
succinctly.  Units of measure reduced the chance of errors dramatically: 
Prices, probabilities, derivatives, etc. can already be kept apart at compile time.

F# is central to Microsoft’s quantum algorithm research. The LIQUi|⟩ simulator (Language 
Integrated Quantum Operations) presents an extension of F# that presents a 
seamless integration of classical and quantum operations. The scale and efficiency 
of the simulator allows it to handle among the largest entangled 
systems of qubits (quantum bits) ever modeled utilizing a targeted linear algebra package 
written entirely in F#. In addition, the modular architecture allows users to 
easily extend the system in any desired research direction. The base library is 
well over 20,000 lines of code and implements a wide range of modules including 
circuits, molecular modeling, spin-glass systems, quantum error correction, machine 
learning, factoring and many others. The system runs in client, server and cloud 
environments. It is also designed to be used as an educational tool and we have 
found that bringing new users up to speed is a quick and painless process.

3. Microsoft Research, [permalink](#andrew-phillips-1)

I lead the Biological Computation group at Microsoft Research, where we are developing methods and
software for [modelling and analysis of biological systems](http://research.microsoft.com/biology). 
We have been using F# in our group for the past 7 years, and it's the language of choice for all 
of our software development. In particular it forms the basis of our software for programming 
[computational circuits made of DNA](http://research.microsoft.com/dna), for programming 
[genetic devices that operate inside cells](http://research.microsoft.com/gec), and for programming 
[complex biological processes in a modular way](http://research.microsoft.com/spim). 

The functional data structures and static type-checking that F# provides are ideally suited for developing 
these domain-specific languages, and the Visual Studio integration is superb for debugging 
and source control. The integration with .Net is seamless, and allows us to incorporate 
efficient numerical and visualisation libraries written in C#. It also allows us to 
take advantage of the full suite of .Net UI components. 

Our languages are specified with a formal syntax and semantics, which are rigorously 
analysed prior to their implementation. Programming in a functional language like F# brings the implementation much closer to the 
formal specification, which is important for ensuring accurate simulation and 
probabilistic analysis. Correct implementation of the semantics is critical, since even 
small coding errors can give rise to divergent predictions, which can in turn compromise 
biological experiments. F# is a great language for writing clean, concise code, which is 
statically typed within a professional development environment that supports a wealth of 
libraries. It will continue to be our language of choice for scientific computing.

With an idea for a new domain specific language, my team chose F# for its functional paradigm, maturity, and ease of interoperation with the .NET framework.  I wrote the language primitives in F#’s arsenal of data types (records, discriminated unions, a couple classes at the top level), implemented operations on the types using its hierarchy of modules, and turned our operations into a working demo in F# Interactive, all in about 10 days.  

I jumped for joy each time my code executed correctly on the first pass, and in the few cases it did not, debugging through Visual Studio felt natural and quick.  As for .NET, integrating with Microsoft Excel was easy by importing the necessary DLLs, though Excel posed challenges beyond F#’s reach.  Finally, I can verify that F# delivers a sense of correctness and safety, stronger than other languages I worked with in the past.  It is reassuring to know your code will execute exactly as you intend.

Using this material in an [F#-based course](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02157)
introducing the fundamental concepts of functional programming has
been a delightful experience as well. The simple,
well-designed, yet powerful, core of the language was perfect for
that purpose and, to our surprise, the transition from using SML
to using F# actually made the tooling easier for students no
matter which platforms they used.

Furthermore, F# with it rich runtime environment has proved to be
an excellent programming platform in research applications and in
a more advanced course aiming at showing the role of functional
programming in a broad variety of applications ranging from
computer science applications to more real-life applications. In
the first version of this course, given together with Anh-Dung Phan,
the students completed three projects in three weeks: One being an
interpreter for a rich imperative programming language,
another being implementation, application and analysis of a
functional pearl, and the last being a curriculum planning system

3. [permalink](#hans-rischel)

I was approached by my former colleague Michael (Michael R. Hansen) in autumn 
2010 where he proposed that we should write a new textbook on functional 
programming - now using the F# programming language. To begin with I was quite 
sceptical about using a programming language appearing as part of a Microsoft 
program package. Solving a number of programming problems using the language 
convinced me, however, of the supreme qualities of F# - and we embarked on 
the project of getting acquainted with F# and writing the textbook. 

Michael and I spent considerable time solving traditional programming 
problems in F#. A combination of functional and imperative F# with an 
occasional pinch of OO gives a very pleasing platform for program 
development - once you have found your way through the wilderness of MSDN 
documentation (newcomers to the MSDN world may benefit from the 
MSDN library documentation found on the [web-site of the book](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/~mire/FSharpBook)). 
All of Chapter 10 and part of Chapter 11 present program examples using 
this programming style.

Computation expressions look esoteric to begin with, but they are actually 
rather useful. We spent much time 
trying to get this concept down to earth, with the purpose of making it accessible 
to simple-minded people like ourselves. The reader may judge how far we 
succeeded by studying Chapter 12 of the book. 

Writing this textbook with Michael has been an exciting experience.

At the University of Pisa we use F# for teaching UI programming, a fundamental course in the third year curriculum. 
In 2014 two more courses (Programming I & II) will use F# and Try F#. 

We use F# for teaching because it fits teaching both fundamentals and technology thanks to rich programming 
environment and libraries to access all system resources (such as UIs). Moreover, F# feels like a dynamic 
language thanks to F# interactive even if it is a statically typed language.  Our students use F# on Windows, 
Mac and Linux. Try F# is a particularly valuable tool for teaching because it has a quite sophisticated 
editor with interactive evaluation and the ability of sharing saved files with students.

I’ve also used F# for teaching programming for scientists at Scuola Normale Superiore, a PhD 
course at ITU Copenhagen and to graduate students in biomedical engineering. 

We recommend teaching F# because it is an extraordinary and flexible tool for teaching different areas of 
Computer Science. The language is rich and its functional nature allows to easily define the appropriate 
subset for teaching particular concepts. I use it to teach entire classes by typing code and evaluate interactively 
discussing the results of a single evaluation. It is also a great tool for teaching programming to scientists 
and engineers: I found that its mathematical roots in lambda calculus are more readily grasped by 
non-programmers, and interactive evaluation recalls environments such as Matlab and Mathematica very 
popular in these communities.

but also PhD) use F#  as the underlying programming language. This is even more the case now since
part of our research directions includes working on cloud/distributed systems. 

F# and its programming environment  leverage with no doubt the ability and the productivity of my 
students. This is, in my opinion,  for two main reasons. First, F# allows the student, but also the 
researcher like me,  to focus on the key aspects of his creation, while, secondly,  enhancing  
technologically the work done in a so remarkable and facilitated way.  Once drawn in paper and pencil, 
an algorithm is naturally implemented in F# and easily deployed in whatever is its execution context.

common CLR, we did not throw everything away. We just started to simplify more and more because the F# code

We use F# in oceanographic research to connect multiple visualizations together in time and space, which is map-plane location and depth. We began by building our Narwhal Developers Library for Layerscape 
in C# with emphasis on visualizing flow lines and understanding drift experiment data. These data are quite complex, involving physical ocean state and measurement of microbial metabolic processes, consolidating remote sensing and passive drifters, and adding to all this current measurements with the tracks of autonomous robots. Our technical term for the visualization challenge is ‘horrible’. 

To cope with the horrible we began adding F# scripts; and this has been extremely productive, particularly in morphing ideas about data exploration into real tools quickly. Our most interesting achievement to date is to wire a chart into a 4D visual environment. The set-up is like this: The scientist sees two views of the data: First color coded structure in a curtain plot of time versus depth (chlorophyll coded as color for example), and second this same data time-boxed in the dynamic Worldwide Telescope (WWT) visualization engine. F# is used to wire them together: Left click (and drag) in the chart to scroll the WWT clock back and forth.  Right-click + drag in the chart to select a subset of the data which is then used to construct a new (small) advection visualization. Because the selected pieces are small and chosen interactively we get around the horrible problem of seeing everything at once.  It is like seeing an entire forest and making all but a few curious trees vanish. So F# has been a great way to make rapid progress, and fun to learn as well.

Over the last 6 or so months, I've been working on a Vim emulation layer. This is the first major project I've ever done with F# 
and I have to say I love the language. In many ways I used this project as a method of learning 
F# (and this learning curve is very much evident if you look through the history of the project). 
What I find the most amazing about F# is just how concise of a language it is. The Vim engine comprises 
the bulk of the logic yet it only comprises 30% of the overall code base.

With F#... we have written a complete genome re-sequencing pipeline with interface, algorithms, 
reporting in ~5K lines and it has been incredibly reliable, fast  and easy to maintain.

F# rocks - we're building out various algorithms for DNA processing here and it's like a drug.  Just 
implemented a suffix tree in 150 lines that can index 200,000 bases a second ;)    We have probably 
10-20K lines of code for many scientific applications ranging from a full genome sequencing 
pipeline that reconstructs and annotated yeast strains, to simulators for various processes 
and design tools for building DNA sequences/constructs.  There are lab located apps that 
grab robot log files and move them to databases and a tool for viewing a huge collection of DNA sequencing data.

F# has been phenomenally useful.  I would be writing a lot of this in Python otherwise and F# is more
robust, 20x - 100x faster to run and for anything but the most trivial programs, faster to develop.

The UI work is especially gratifying, because state of the art for a lot of genomic data display 
is still PNG images embedded in JavaScript and with F# I can render half a million data points on 
a web page without jumping through hoops.

With Units of Measure I started labelling the coordinates as one or zero based and immediately found a bug where I'd casually mixed the two systems. Yay F#!

I am involved in bioinformatics and computational genomics as a faculty member at the 
University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).  In an academic medical center like UNMC there 
are heavy demands on my time and a wide range of different types of research projects that 
I can end up working on.  I have used the F# programming language on both the .NET and Mono 
frameworks for several of these projects, including one that involved a very productive 
collaboration with IntelliFactory and the use of WebSharper.  
You can visit the resulting [web site](http://app1.unmc.edu/fgx) and read the freely 
available peer-reviewed scientific publication that describes the important 
[infectious disease research](http://mbio.asm.org/content/4/1/e00537-12.long) 
that this F# software development project facilitates.  I am always interested in 
opportunities to work with professional software development enterprises whose teams include 
developers with F# expertise, because I believe that many attributes of the F# programming 
language make it an ideal choice for the development of software solutions that integrate 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and the exponentially growing volumes of molecular analysis 
data that can now be obtained from individual patients (e.g., personal genome DNA sequencing data).

There's an exciting future for F# in this huge, emerging, data-rich health care market.

I did a public records request in my town of Cary, North Carolina.  The dataset included appx 25,000 traffic stop records for 2012. Using F#, I did some basic statistical calculations to determine that when you are driving is much more important than where you are driving in terms of getting stopped.  In fact, the term 'speed trap' is a misnomer.  In addition, the data supports the notion that there is a monthly quota of tickets being given.   You can read the entire analysis [here](http://jamessdixon.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/traffic-stop-analysis-using-f/)

Also, I created a KNN classifier using the date/time of the stop and determined that when you get stopped impacts weather you get a verbal warning versus an actual ticket.  You can read the entire analysis [here](http://jamessdixon.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/traffic-stop-disposition-classification-using-f-and-knn/)

Finally, I did a public records request in the county in which I live: Wake County North Carolina.  The dataset included appx 5,000 health inspection scores for 2012. Using F#, I did some basic statistical calculations to determine that there is little variance of when a restaurant gets inspected and their final score.  An interesting offshoot is that some particular restaurants scored lower across all inspectors - except when head inspector did the inspection, then they actually scored better.  There might an inherent cultural bias by the inspectors.  You can read the entire analysis [here](http://jamessdixon.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/analysis-of-health-inspection-data-using-f/)

F# was great because I spent less time figuring out how to answer my question and more time actually answering the question.  The type providers made consuming and integrating hetrogenous datasets a snap and the pattern matching feature reduced the complexity of the code by an order of magnitude (compared to C#).   Finally, by using unit tests and immutable data types, I have a bug-resistant code base that can be extended to other scenarios.

All of our back-end data processing and parsing is done in F#. The power and flexibility of the
language lets us ship features faster, with fewer bugs. Regressions are virtually nonexistent, and the
functional nature of the language makes it easy to ensure that our code is testable.

Our first iterations were written in C#, but after switching to F#, we saw a drastic reduction in code size,
along with an increase in readability. We'll definitely be sticking with F# for all of our future projects.

I’ve been using F# libraries in otherwise mostly C# / VB.NET web applications. Thanks to the conciseness of F#, I can develop these libraries in a fraction of the time, then I consume them from C# and VB.NET just like any other library.

Furthermore, F#’s succint syntax and REPL make it an excellent scripting language and good for data exploration. Thanks to F#’s interoperability the scripts can easily use domains and libraries written in C#. You never need to start from scratch or have to reinvent things.

Language features like record types, discriminated unions and type inference also make F# a great language for prototyping. I often prototype new business domains in F# with a few simplified use cases to refine it. The simple syntax allows me to focus on developing the domain and iterate more quickly. Then, when company policy requires it, I translate it to C# which is usually a straightforward process that ends up with many times more lines of code (yet still perfectly maintainable).

Vector code is a code generator for iOS and OsX generating code in Objective C, Swift and C#. It works with vector graphics, parses and runs SVG. It is developed with F# on a Mac.

F# is a first class language for Mac OsX. Thanks to the open source compiler, Mono and Xamarin, I was able to build a vector drawing, code generator software with F#. It is really amazing experience! The tooling is great and keeps improving. The compiler and the language  are basically the same which is fantastic!

F# is a powerful language and it is great to do cross platform development with it. I used heavily quotations for generating code in different languages on vector code. Powerful type system and static compilation meant that, once the application compiled without errors and warnings, it will just work and generate complete code. It did, and now at the App Store.

I was consulting at engagement for a large multi-national organization that produces financial software where the need to rewrite the component that deals with importing data from various flat-file formats was identified.  The component needed to handle complex business logic and user defined mapping.

F# was chosen over C# as it provided a large number of language features related to mapping out of the box.  Code quotations, discriminated unions, partial application, matching, and active patterns were used extensively.  Having objects immutable by default made the logic very deterministic and easy to maintain / follow.

I was incredibly happy with the results, particularly with the declarative nature I could use to describe the various mappings, and their relationship with other mappings.  This should make it much easier for other developers and the business analysts to figure out what logic is executed when a particular mapping occurs.  The core logic saw a big reduction in code size, however, the real saving was in the entity specific mapping logic which saw the lines of code required go down by more than 90 percent! 

F# is definitely a language I will be recommending to clients going forward.

When starting to work with Microsoft's "Modern" WinRT apps, I started by taking the obvious route and used C#. This worked, and I wrote good, functional apps. Despite this, modern programming with C# has problems. I encountered these when writing my BitTorrent app, Surge, and eventually rewrote the app using F#. Doing this gave me better performance, fewer bugs and better user satisfaction.

Users expect performant software with an always responsive UI, and frequently expect the apps to work with and display large amounts of data. This leads to us, as developers, working with complex data structures, detailed lists, and to use techniques like parallelism and asynchrony. C# has gained support for these over time, through things like Linq and async/await, but these are poor imitations of the original F# implementations and have flaws.

Using a modern, functional language that provides first-class support for things we need in modern development is a no-brainer. Immutability-first as a programming technique has fixed more bugs and bad code in my applications than almost anything else I've ever looked at, and it's something C# will never gain.

It's not just C#, either. Many languages are evolving to be ready for the future, adding features that support the needs of a modern programming language, but F# is already there.

The site amancai.com.au was built combining F#, Domain-Driven Desing, Asp.Net MVC and Azure. F# was an excellent choice as it allowed us to keep the code lean and very functional while having full access to the BCL, Azure and third party libraries. 

Using F# Type Providers also helped us to improve our productivity and find problems early during the development process. 

I personally enjoyed the experience of building the entire system using F#, I believe its "functional-first" approach is excellent for building a wide range of applications.

At Green Eagle Solutions, we develop control systems for renewable energy plants. Thus, it's crucial for us to test our software in a real-time environment where are all the other actors (protocols, weather conditions, legacy software) come into play.

Beforehand, we used Python to quickly build simulators to test our components. With F# we have now all the advantages of a dynamic language, while keeping the static typing safety we are used to. The fact that we don't need to leave Visual Studio and being able to seamlessly use all the APIs we have developed in C# are also a big plus.

We have also started to use F# directly in our components to implementing the core logic, while leaving C# to networking tasks. We've taking advantage of this language mix to create a dependency injector which recompiles the F# logic at runtime whenever the script changes for quick development iterations, but loads a precompiled .dll when deployed in production. The double nature of F# as a scripting and a compiled language really shines here.

F# terse syntax made the final code look really similar to the algorithm we wrote at first in formal language. Also, we've come to really appreciate the numerous metaprogramming libraries in the F# ecosystem: we particularly like FSharp.Formatting and have started to adopt the literate programming style to integrate as much as possible the code and the documentation and prevent them losing sync.

When I started working on the T2 temporal logic prover, I knew little about termination analysis and formal verification. F# made it easy to dive into these concepts and boosted my productivity by allowing me to write clean, concise, and accurate programs. Its functional nature, clear syntax and type inference is combined with the flexibility to write in an imperative style and use the .NET framework. This combination powerfully bridges the gap between thinking about a concept and implementing it. Programming in F# feels like writing out ideas rather than code.
